## Input and output format

The input files for SEAS are in table text format. The table column can be separated by ‘tab’ or ‘comma’. ‘Tab’ is more preferred. Excel is recommended to prepare the input text file.

- The clinical table first column should be the sample identifier (i.e. patient ID). An example of the clinical table format is as follow:

- The embedding table only has three columns: the sample identifier, the embedding x-coordinate of these samples, and the embedding y-coordinate of these samples. An example of the clinical table format is as follow:
